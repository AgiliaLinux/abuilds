longdesc=('Poppler is a library based on the xpdf PDF viewer developed by Derek Noonburg of Glyph and Cog, LLC. Since xpdf does not provide a shared library, whenever a flaw was found potentially dozens of applications incorporating code from xpdf would have to be patched. By providing a centralized PDF library this duplicated effort will be eliminated.')
