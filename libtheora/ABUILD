longdesc=("Theora is Xiph.Org's first publicly released video codec, intended for use within the Foundation's Ogg multimedia streaming system. The Theora bitstream format was frozen after the alpha3 release. This means that files produced by the alpha3 encoder will always be playable according to the Theora I specification. Traditionally alpha means a proof of concept, not a production-ready release. However the code is very robust, ready for and indeed in general use.")
